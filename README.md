Assignment:
The Shady Pines Retirement Village the needs a VB program to calculate the monthly charge
for living in the village.
Shady Pines offers the following apartments:
Empire Apartment $1,500.00 per month
Italianate Apartment $1,650.00 per month
Charlestown Apartment $1900.00 per month
Regency Apartment $2000.00 per month
The apartments can be occupied by either one or two people. There is no difference in rent
whether there be one or two people inhabiting the apartment.
Each resident of Shady Pines must take a meal plan. They are as follows:
7 meals per week $400.00 per month
14 meals per week $710.00 per month
21 meals per week $980.00 per month
Create a VB application for Shady Pines which has two forms. The startup form holds the
names of the apartments along with the amount of rent. The second form holds the number of
people inhabiting the apartment (either 1 or 2) and the meal plans. When the user selects the
apartment, the number of people in the apartment and the meal plan chosen, the total charges
for the month should be shown on the startup form.
